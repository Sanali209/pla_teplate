# Journal — Session 7c0d8cfa-06b9-4025-ba11-46a4d506c241

## Context
Goal: Analyze protocols metadata and templates for integrating dependency analysis into pipelines, affecting roadmap and sprint creation.

## Progress
- Initial research started.
- Analyzed `Metadata_Schema.md` and `Validation_Rules.md`.
- Found `_blueprint/protocols/` structure.
- Created `dev_log/` and this journal file.

## Findings
- Standardized YAML metadata for GL, FT, RS, UC, TSK.
- Traceability is strictly enforced via `parent_*` fields.
- Status transitions are regulated.
- Found existing `roadmap.md`, `E1_Sprint_Execution.md`, and `P5_Sprint_Planning.md`.

## Decisions
- [D1] Initializing `dev_log` and `journal` as per user global rules.
- [D2] Added `dependencies` field to `FT` and `TSK` in `Metadata_Schema.md`.
- [D3] Updated `validate_traceability.py` with G8 Dependency Gate – Rationale: enforce that dependencies are met before completion.
- [D4] Adding `analyze_dependencies` tool to MCP – Rationale: provide programmatic access to the dependency graph.
- [D5] Implemented G9 Circular Dependency detection – Rationale: prevent planning deadlocks.
- [D6] Enhanced `search_artifacts` to show blockages – Rationale: improve visibility in the backlog.

## Next Steps
- Finalize roadmap/sprint planning integration.
- Final user review.
